## üìã PROJECT INFORMATION

### Status
- **Last Verified**: October 30, 2025
- **Status**: Educational research completed - **Project archived, author has moved on**
- **Browser Requirement**: Brave user agent (or equivalent fingerprint spoofing)
- **Current State**: Functional as of date above, but CAPTCHAs make it impractical

### Project Context
**"This project was pretty fun, but the captchas they added are just annoying"** - Original Author

The author has stated they no longer actively maintain this project and have moved on to CAPTCHA solver research instead.

### Overview
This is a research project exploring:
- Browser fingerprinting techniques
- Anti-detection mechanisms in web automation
- CAPTCHA systems and their implementation
- User behavior detection (typing patterns, mouse movement)

**Important Note**: This is a **fully working script** to create threads/post on soyjak (as of the verified date), **but only when faking a Brave user agent**. However, due to detection mechanisms, users may encounter impossible-to-solve fake CAPTCHAs if detected.

### Technical Details

#### Detection Mechanisms Identified
The target site implements:
1. **Heavy browser fingerprinting**
   - Canvas fingerprinting
   - WebGL fingerprinting
   - Audio context fingerprinting
   - Font enumeration
   - Hardware concurrency detection

2. **Behavioral analysis**
   - User typing patterns
   - Mouse movement tracking
   - Interaction timing analysis

3. **Anti-automation measures**
   - CAPTCHA systems (including impossible fake CAPTCHAs upon detection)
   - User agent validation
   - TLS fingerprinting

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning**: If you get detected, you will receive fake CAPTCHAs that are **impossible to solve**. This is an intentional anti-bot measure.

*Interface example - Note: Use with soyjak-wiki open to identify which soyjak they reference (if you're not an active soyteen poster)*

*Browser configuration and fingerprinting setup example*

#### Research Findings
- Standard Puppeteer browser instances are **detected**
- User interaction patterns (typing/mouse) trigger detection
- Browser queue systems can help manage detection
- Fingerprint browsers show better evasion (but still not recommended for actual use)

**Key Discovery**: "Something in the users' action is detected - no idea what they are doing - but let's say you just do the Puppeteer booting you can just - you know - go and post (when you open the Node.js browser **this part is not detected**)"

**Two primary detection vectors identified:**
1. User typing patterns
2. Mouse movement behavior

**Note from researcher**: "Look I don't care about this project anymore - I want to create a captcha solver - right now I can't. The best on the market is (but is paid)..."

### Referenced Tools & Technologies

## üîç RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

### Fingerprinting Analysis
Notice there is **very heavy fingerprinting** done on this site - take it into account when conducting research.

### Browser Configuration
- Completed with a browser queue system
- Requires Brave user agent spoofing for functionality
- Standard Node.js Puppeteer browsers can be opened without initial detection
- Detection triggers on specific user actions

### Detection Bypass Limitations
While the script works technically, practical limitations include:
- CAPTCHA systems that become impossible when bot behavior is detected
- Behavioral analysis that monitors typing and mouse patterns
- Fingerprinting that identifies automated browsers over time
