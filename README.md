even the jannies -- went into this shit
... I have brain damage -- but i am not re***ded --- i know jannies know i lie,,, and i know i li



## ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

## ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

DISCLAIMER , i am not affiliited with LETO , i hate him --- and i blocked him myself cuz he is a silly faggot 

--- part of the joke --- was pretending to be LETO--- to give him more legal trouble 


and second i just say stuff just to trick the jannies and put stress under them --- 
i just hate how the site went into downhill 

I already own around 80pph in 4chan , using llm chatbots --- 
soyjak is next , for an educational thing 

i myself i am a south african schizo living in israel,, and i have a gout attack recently --- 
i am fachinated by, causing stress to jannies 

but yeah -- pretending, and lieing --- like the stuff claim by quete is untrue 

he declares stuff I did not do ---

and yes I spent over 11hours -- and so people spend time on CSGO or other videos ,,, 
its a game for me

What they gonna do ? they are powerless --- I already have a very sabtle bot working on mobile emulators -- this other project is unnoticable to the jannies 

What the jannies gonna do ? 

**This is a protest to the jannies , your captcha sucks --- it so hard for a user to solve , and what are you trying to prevent the site from gaining users??? even an ANONCHAN like me who been on board for years**

the captchas are shit , and if you wanna stop me enable captchas per post ,, this is what I want, this is what will make me stop
--- I wanna make it harder to post --- because the site sucks --- and the pph by normal users shall drop 


SAYING I AM AFFLIATED WITH LETO ? 
while i didnt talked to him in years -- 

plus i found him weird and ghosted his messages all the time 

but yeah -- i think he had a "4chan B& evade serivice" this was my idea -- to try and monitize it a bit -- i came with that idea --- 
honestly -- i started going it again -- after the arthritis attack i had last august 

and yes, i am a wagie -- my income goes from online e-commerce --- 
I earn a fair wage --- higher than being a janny, which the downfall they got harder 
--- anyways i can even rent a good house in RAMAT GAN

**
back in the day i also ran 4chan bots to put ads for soyjak -- 
but yeah i hope they put harder and harder captchas ---  lol , I already have a captcha solver -- it just takes 15seconds per captcha -- but it works -- **

**Why admit you lie, and say you gonna flood them with 'p ,, just to cause them stress and demoralise them --- so the janny wont want to go on the modpanel anymore **

Also yeah fuck the jannies , fuck the soyjak 


speaking of, the only one evading the law is SoyQuote,, 
he is violeting my rights, as a british citizen 
(as per my south african citizenship too)
suig my voorhuid

**also i am not jewish ,,
christ is king

## 📋 PROJECT INFORMATION

### Status
- **Last Verified**: October 30, 2025
- **Status**: Educational research completed - **Project archived, author has moved on**
- **Browser Requirement**: Brave user agent (or equivalent fingerprint spoofing)
- **Current State**: Functional as of date above, but CAPTCHAs make it impractical

### Project Context
**"This project was pretty fun, but the captchas they added are just annoying"** - Original Author

The author has stated they no longer actively maintain this project and have moved on to CAPTCHA solver research instead.

### Overview
This is a research project exploring:
- Browser fingerprinting techniques
- Anti-detection mechanisms in web automation
- CAPTCHA systems and their implementation
- User behavior detection (typing patterns, mouse movement)

**Important Note**: This is a **fully working script** to create threads/post on soyjak (as of the verified date), **but only when faking a Brave user agent**. However, due to detection mechanisms, users may encounter impossible-to-solve fake CAPTCHAs if detected.

### Technical Details

#### Detection Mechanisms Identified
The target site implements:
1. **Heavy browser fingerprinting**
   - Canvas fingerprinting
   - WebGL fingerprinting
   - Audio context fingerprinting
   - Font enumeration
   - Hardware concurrency detection

2. **Behavioral analysis**
   - User typing patterns
   - Mouse movement tracking
   - Interaction timing analysis

3. **Anti-automation measures**
   - CAPTCHA systems (including impossible fake CAPTCHAs upon detection)
   - User agent validation
   - TLS fingerprinting

**⚠️ Critical Warning**: If you get detected, you will receive fake CAPTCHAs that are **impossible to solve**. This is an intentional anti-bot measure.

#### Visual Documentation

![Working Interface Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6170652-794b-47ab-a9e6-11b40f219edd)
*Interface example - Note: Use with soyjak-wiki open to identify which soyjak they reference (if you're not an active soyteen poster)*

![Browser Configuration Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05281b4d-8658-4599-8964-371607ebd4c0)
*Browser configuration and fingerprinting setup example*

#### Research Findings
- Standard Puppeteer browser instances are **detected**
- User interaction patterns (typing/mouse) trigger detection
- Browser queue systems can help manage detection
- Fingerprint browsers show better evasion (but still not recommended for actual use)

**Key Discovery**: "Something in the users' action is detected - no idea what they are doing - but let's say you just do the Puppeteer booting you can just - you know - go and post (when you open the Node.js browser **this part is not detected**)"

**Two primary detection vectors identified:**
1. User typing patterns
2. Mouse movement behavior

**Note from researcher**: "Look I don't care about this project anymore - I want to create a captcha solver - right now I can't. The best on the market is (but is paid)..."

## 🔍 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

### Fingerprinting Analysis
Notice there is **very heavy fingerprinting** done on this site - take it into account when conducting research.

### Browser Configuration
- Completed with a browser queue system
- Requires Brave user agent spoofing for functionality
- Standard Node.js Puppeteer browsers can be opened without initial detection
- Detection triggers on specific user actions

### Detection Bypass Limitations
While the script works technically, practical limitations include:
- CAPTCHA systems that become impossible when bot behavior is detected
- Behavioral analysis that monitors typing and mouse patterns
- Fingerprinting that identifies automated browsers over time
