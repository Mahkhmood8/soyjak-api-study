**this project was pretty fun , but the captcahs they added are just annoying**
**Fun researching, this is completed with a browser queue system**
This is a fully working script to create threads / post on soyjak 

it does work as of 30/10/2025 -** only when faking a brave user agent - **

notice there are some fingerprinting done in this site, 
very heavy fingerprinting - so take it into account


**please do not misuse, just study antidetect and webscrapping**

**be careful if you get detected you get fake captchas they are imposible to solve---**

notice something in the users action is detected --- no idea what they are doing -- 
but let say you just do the puppetteer booting you can just -- you know --- go and post (when you open the nodejs browser **this is part is not detected**)

**two things they detect user typing and mouse movement**


Look I dont care about this porject anymore --- I want to create a captcha solver -- right now i cant
